# Lesson 3.2 - Parameter Handling

We're not done with the grat new features that ES2015 has when it comes to
dealing with parameters and variables. There are more powerful new features
available that help with handling parameters in functions.

## Default Parameter Values

If you've ever seen code that looks like this and cringed:

```js
function add(x, y) {
  if (!x) x = 1
  if (!y) y = 2
  return x + y
}
```

This is typically how you would have handled assigning default parameters to
a function in past versions of JavaScript. With new ES2015 features, this
can now be handled seamlessly:

```js
function add(x = 1, y = 2) {
  return x + y
}
```

Now that's pretty neat! What we're saying there is exactly the same as the
code above. If no `x` value is passed in, then assign it the value of `1`. The
same goes for the `y` value. This new feature makes it very easy to assign
default values to your function parameters, without all the extra code to
check if they exist like we did above. Awesome!

## Rest Parameters

We're not done yet! There's another great new feature that we can use in a
variety of ways to make parameter decalrations for functions incredibly
dynamic and easy to use. The next one we'll talk about is rest parameters.

Using rest parameters, we can allow a dynamic number of arguments to be passed
into a function:

```js
function add(...numbers) {
  var total = 0
  numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    total += number
  })
  return total
}
```

So what's going on there? Any time you declare a parameter in a function
using the spread operator, it returns all of those parameters as an array.
We can then just iterate over the collection of params and perform our
addition! This is very handy in a lot of cases.

It also works when you have required parameters:
```js
function product(multiplier = 1, ...numbers) {
  var total = 0
  numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    total += number
  })
  return total * multiplier
}
```

## Spread Operator

Great! We're learning some really cool new features here, and there's one
more that we haven't yet uncovered. It's called the spread operator. The spread
operator allows us to assign an entire array of variables all in one fell
swoop. Here's an example:

```js
var ary = [1, 2, 3]
var other = [4, 5, 6, ...ary]
console.log(other)
-> [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
```

That's pretty neat! We were able to define a new array that contained the
contents of the other array by simply using the spread operator! You can also
use this syntax to unpack strings into an array:

```js
var str = 'foo'
var chars = [ ...str ]
console.log(chars)
-> ['f', 'o', 'o']
```

## Moving on...

Awesome! We've learned a lot about new ways to handle variables in ES2015. Let's
write a few code examples so that we can see how we would use this stuff in the
real world!
